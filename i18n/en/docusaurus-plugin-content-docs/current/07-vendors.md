# Vendors — Management

## Overview
Vendors (suppliers) represent external parties providing inventory. This page documents the vendor data model, mapping to products, and procurement-related flows.

## Key components
- Vendor profile: code, name, contact details, default lead times.
- Product relationships: SKU-level vendor assignments, purchase price, MOQ.
- Purchase orders: creating POs, receiving goods, stock reconciliation.
- Accounting fields: vendor terms, payment methods, tax IDs.

## Integration notes
- When creating POs automatically from low stock rules, include a pre-check and approval workflow.
- Maintain historical vendor-product price records for audit and reporting.
