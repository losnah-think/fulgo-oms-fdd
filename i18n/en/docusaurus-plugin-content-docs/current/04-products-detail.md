# Product — Detail

## Overview
The Product Detail page centralizes a product's canonical data, marketplace-specific mappings, stock and price sync settings, and attribute-level mappings.

## Sections
- Core data: SKU, title, description, brand, weight, dimensions.
- Marketplace mappings: per-marketplace SKU/ID, listing status, marketplace-specific attributes.
- Inventory & pricing: current stock by warehouse, reserved quantity, price overrides per marketplace.
- Images & media: primary image and gallery with upload/ordering controls.
- Attribute mappings: category mapping, option mapping (e.g., size/color), custom fields.

## Integration notes
- Edits to canonical product data may trigger re-listing or patch updates to marketplaces; provide confirmation dialogs for destructive changes.
- Attribute-level mappings should preserve historical mapping IDs for reconciliation.
